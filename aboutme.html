        <br>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I have over 5 years of experience programming with Java and more than 2 years with Python. I've contributed in web development projects as a frontend team member, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build user-friendly and robust landing pages. 
            I've also collaborated with backend teams, deploying web applications using Django and Flask, and integrating SQL databases to ensure seamless functionality.</p>
        <p>In addition, I am proficient in a large range of development tools, including AndroidStudio, VisualStudioCode, and Eclipse, as well as React libraries for both academic and personal projects.</p>
